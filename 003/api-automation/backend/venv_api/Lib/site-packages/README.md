Forked from [pypika](https://github.com/kayak/pypika) and adapted just for tortoise-orm.

## Why forked?

The original repository includes many databases that Tortoise ORM doesn’t require. It aims to be a comprehensive SQL builder with broad compatibility, but that’s not the goal for Tortoise ORM. Having it forked makes it easier to add new features for Tortoise.

## What changed?

Deleted unnecessary code that Tortoise ORM doesn’t require, and added features tailored specifically for Tortoise ORM.

## ThanksTo

- [pypika](https://github.com/kayak/pypika), a Python SQL query builder that exposes the full expressiveness of SQL, 
using a syntax that mirrors the resulting query structure.
